									<p>One of the main projects I worked on in the end of 2020. The project was to create an application that can take in debits and credits for a system that uses money. This was a team effort and we mainly used Cloud to host the actual application. We used Razor for the APIs and bootstrap. We also used jquery to make a lot of the functionalities on the website. There was also a lot of database work put into this in order to make all the accounts and money saving be put and stored somewhere. </p>
									<p>Along with this, we also created a lot of documentation, we made a create user, create password, and forgot password pages for the user. We inplemented an email system, where the user gets an email in order to get their account verfied. We had muliple users that had different credentials as well.</p>

									<h2>Role Playing Game</h2>
									<p>This project consisted of creating a project and then handing it off to someone else. So in my case I picked up a project that involved a role playing game, I had to edit it, made sure it functioned, and then make test cases for it. The project itself was in C#.</p>
									<p>This project took a lot of time in testing and figuring out all the issues when the code itself and being able to solve it by testing every part of the program. It was overall extremely fun and one of my favorite projects to do as I learned a lot about how to catch mistakes, but I also learned about Nunit and testing in general. It also helped me understand how to work in a situation where you are working with someone elses code.</p>

									<h2>IP Creator</h2>
									<p>This was another web application that I worked on with a team as my senior project in the Fall of 2020. This project consists of using bootstrap and jquery. We used Azure as the cloud database to store all of the information. This project is meant for patents and keeping track of fresh and new ideas. The project consisted of a lot of front end testing and back end work, along with keeping the databases live and making sure all the databases correspond with the information being saved.</p>
									<p>In terms of professionalism, this project probably had the most of that. As this project was followed in a sprint concept, with a lot of documentation and testing between us the developers and the client who wanted to be part of the user testing.</p>
